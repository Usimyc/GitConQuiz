# GitConQuiz

A small browser-based quiz game created for the **GitKon 2025 Game Jam**.

This project was made by somebody illiterate in git, who has to ask an AI how to setup the repro for entering the jam. Brilliant, ain't it?!
On a more serious approach - this game explores fun examples of good and not so good commit practices. It is yet only a demo made in 5 days and can be explored further with different examples.
